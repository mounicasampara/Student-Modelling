# Student-Modelling
This is a local website that runs through Shniy. It is an adaptive e-learning platform which is used for preparation for tests like GRE. Instead of a one-size-fits-all model of other platforms, this website gives you tailored practice and analysis. It gives adaptive training based on user's performance and according to requirement. 
It determines the knowledge level of the user in all the topics related to the examination. I have designed an algorithm that is derived from Dempster-Shafer theory. By taking the statistics of answers, i determine the probability that the user would answer a question based on that concept correctly.
